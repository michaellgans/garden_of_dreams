## What is Caraway?
Caraway is your home for discovering native plants in your state. Use our page to view dynamically and randomly loaded seed-packets to build your garden. Support local wildlife and pollinators, promote water conservation, and reduce carbon emissions.

## Usage
Caraway is hosted with github pages. Use this [link](https://michaellgans.github.io/garden_of_dreams/) to navigate to our page. Once on the homepage, you can enter into the garden with the 'Start Exploring' button. The garden page allows you to select your state and get started!

## Inspiration
This project was part of our HackSprint in the third trimester at Atlas School Tulsa. Our prompt was based around building a 'Garden of Dreams', but we were allowed flexibility in our design and purpose.
